**filezilla_import**

`sitemanager.xml` importer for SFTP plugin in Sublime Text 2.

Creates SFTP's `sftp_config.json` from existing entry in FileZilla's `sitemanager.xml`.

Now all FTP/FTPS/SFTP connections can be managed in a single place, using FileZilla's Site Manager UI, and imported into SFTP folders as needed.
